# Validation for FHIR MapBuilder

The goal of this project is to implement a REST API base on [The MatchBox Engine](https://github.com/ahdis/matchbox), from agile health data 
information systems, that allows the FHIR MapBuilder extension to perform compilation, validation, and transformation of an 
FML (FHIR Mapping Language) file provided by MatchBox through REST calls.

This application helps the alignment designer use FML without errors by ensuring syntactic validation.

## MatchBox Engine Dependency

The project use the MatchBox Engine dependency, specifically version 3.9.12.
