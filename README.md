# FHIR MapBuilder

FHIR MapBuilder is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to facilitate the edition of FHIR StructureMap resources
using FHIR Mapping Language (FML).

For a detailed explanation of what this extension does, check out the functional description in  [the extension's README](vscode-extension/README.md).

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository contains two interconnected projects:

1. **vscode-extension** – A Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension written in TypeScript.
2. **fhir-mapbuilder-validation** – A Java Spring Boot REST API that provides backend validation.

The VS Code extension relies on the JAR file generated by the Spring Boot application.

## 🛠 Setup & Installation

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aphp/fhir-mapbuilder.git
cd fhir-mapbuilder
```
### Java 21 Requirement
This application requires Java Development Kit (JDK) version 21 to run.
Please ensure that Java 21 is installed and correctly added to your system's PATH.

### Build & Package the Java Application

```sh
cd fhir-mapbuilder-validation
mvn clean package
```

After running this command, the JAR file `fhir-mapbuilder-validation.jar` will be generated in the `target/` folder.

### Move the JAR File to the Extension Project

```sh
cd ..
mkdir vscode-extension/target
mv fhir-mapbuilder-validation/target/fhir-mapbuilder-validation.jar vscode-extension/target
```

### Install Dependencies & Package the VS Code Extension

```sh
cd vscode-extension
npm install
vsce package --baseImagesUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aphp/fhir-mapbuilder/refs/heads/main/vscode-extension
```

This command will generate a `.vsix` file, which can be installed in VS Code.

## 🚀 Running the Applications

### Start the Java Spring Boot Application

```sh
cd fhir-mapbuilder-validation
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Run the VS Code Extension

1. Open `vscode-extension` in VS Code.
2. Press `F5` to start a new Extension Development Host.

## ⚙️ GitHub Workflows
Several GitHub Actions workflows have been set up to automate key parts of the project:

- **Test Workflow** (test.yml)

This workflow runs automatically on every push or pull request targeting the main branch.
It installs dependencies, compiles TypeScript, and runs the extension's test suite to ensure code quality.

- **Release Workflow** (release.yml)

This workflow is triggered automatically when a new Git tag matching the pattern v* (e.g., v1.0.0) is created.
It packages the VS Code extension into a .vsix file and attaches it to the corresponding GitHub Release on the Releases page.

- **Publish Workflow** (publish.yml)

A dedicated workflow to automatically publish the VS Code extension to the Visual Studio Marketplace.
This workflow can be triggered manually via the GitHub Actions tab and uses a secure token to authenticate the publishing process.
